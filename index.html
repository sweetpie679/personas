            <h2>Project overview</h2>
            <p>This project explores creating realistic personas and storyboarding user journeys that accurately capture complete user experiences as they 
            interact with a chosen interface. The user interaction insights used in this project were obtained by observing the natural interactions of 
            users and interviewing said users.
            </p>  
                      
            <h2>Interface description</h2>
            <p>The interface studied in this project is that of a water fountain in the kitchen, this interface is publicly    accessible and situated in an 
            open area typically designated for staff and graduate students in the computer science department. This study was focused on the hot drinking water 
            experience of users that may interact with this interface. The vital interactive components in this interface are the hot water sensor option and the 
            dispense option as illustrated in the diagram below.
